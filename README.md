# Spam_filter
A project to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam. The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.  In this project, I have used nltk library to preprocess the data. Both Naive Bayes classsifier and Random forest classifier are used, with Naive Bayes performing better based on AUC metric.
